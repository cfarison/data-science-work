*Purpose*: Throughout this course, you'll complete a large number of *exercises* and *challenges*. Exercises are meant to introduce content with easy-to-solve problems, while challenges are meant to make you think more deeply about and apply the content. The challenges will start out highly-scaffolded, and become progressively open-ended.

In this challenge, you will go through the process of exploring, documenting, and sharing an analysis of a dataset. We will use these skills again and again in each challenge.

# Grading Rubric
<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Unlike exercises, **challenges will be graded**. The following rubrics define how you will be graded, both on an individual and team basis.

## Individual
<!-- ------------------------- -->

| Category | Unsatisfactory | Satisfactory |
|----------|----------------|--------------|
| Effort | Some task __q__'s left unattempted | All task __q__'s attempted |
| Observed | Did not document observations | Documented observations based on analysis |
| Supported | Some observations not supported by analysis | All observations supported by analysis (table, graph, etc.) |
| Code Styled | Violations of the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) hinder readability | Code sufficiently close to the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) |

## Team
<!-- ------------------------- -->

| Category | Unsatisfactory | Satisfactory |
|----------|----------------|--------------|
| Documented | No team contributions to Wiki | Team contributed to Wiki |
| Referenced | No team references in Wiki | At least one reference in Wiki to member report(s) |
| Relevant | References unrelated to assertion, or difficult to find related analysis based on reference text | Reference text clearly points to relevant analysis |

## Due Date
<!-- ------------------------- -->

All the deliverables stated in the rubrics above are due on the day of the class discussion of that exercise. See the [Syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jJTh2DH8nVJd2eyMMoyNGroReo0BKcJrz1eONi3rPSc/edit?usp=sharing) for more information.

# Data Exploration
<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

In this first stage, you will explore the `diamonds` dataset and document your observations.

__q1__ Create a plot of `price` vs `carat` of the `diamonds` dataset below. Document your observations from the visual.

*Hint*: We learned how to do this in `e-vis00-basics`!

```{r q1-task}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
  ggtitle("Price vs Carat")
```

**Observations**:

- From 0 to 1 carat, price seems to be clearly positively correlated with carat.
- Past 1 carat, diamond prices can be very high, so there are likely other key factors that contribute to price.
- The minimum price for a diamond seems to increase based on carat, but the maximum price does not (past 1 carat).

__q2__ Create a visualization showing variables `carat`, `price`, and `cut` simultaneously. Experiment with which variable you assign to which aesthetic (`x`, `y`, etc.) to find an effective visual.

```{r q2-task}
diamonds %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price, color = cut)) +
  ggtitle("Price vs Carat, with color as Cut")
```

**Observations**:

With the same carat, poor cut diamonds tend to fetch lower prices. However, many ideal cut diamonds still fetch low prices, which can be seen more clearly in this zoomed in version of the graph.

```{r price-vs-carat-cut-zoom}
diamonds %>%
  filter(carat < 1) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price, color = cut)) +
  ggtitle("Price vs Carat, with color as Cut, for Carat < 1")
```

With the same carat, better clarity diamonds tend to fetch higher prices. Larger diamonds tend to have lower clarity, but can still fetch high prices.

```{r price-vs-carat-clarity}
diamonds %>% 
ggplot() +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price, color = clarity)) +
  ggtitle("Price vs Carat, with color as Clarity")
```

Diamond color looks to be more strongly correlated with carat (better color for lower carat) than with price.
```{r price-vs-carat-color}
diamonds %>% 
ggplot() +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price, color = color)) +
  ggtitle("Price vs Carat, with color as Color")
```

Most diamonds are less than 1.5 carats, so the sample size is smaller for diamonds larger than 1.5 carats and it is harder to draw conclusions. The 3rd quartile is 1.04, but the max is 5.01.

Ideal cut diamonds are the most common in this data set, with a high number of premium and very good as well.

Most diamonds are in the top two clarity buckets.

```{r}
summary(diamonds)
```

Since both better cut and better clarity seem to be correlated with higher price, I wonder if cut and clarity are correlated. It looks like most of the best clarity diamonds also have ideal cut, but poor clarity diamonds are distributed fairly evenly across different cuts. So better cut and better clarity seem to be correlated for the best diamonds, but not for worse diamonds.

```{r cut-vs-clarity}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(cut, clarity)) +
  geom_jitter(aes(color = cut), size = 0.5) +
  ggtitle("Frequency of each Clarity/Cut Combination")
```

How does price vary for the best cut diamonds? For the best cut diamonds, price increases with carat, and the higher clarity diamonds tend to fetch higher prices for a given carat.

```{r price-vs-carat-ideal-cut}
diamonds %>%
  filter(cut == "Ideal") %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price, color = clarity)) +
  ggtitle("Price vs Carat for Ideal Cut only")
```

Carat seems to be the variable most strongly correlated with price. Color does not seem to be correlated with price. Cut and clarity both seem to be somewhat correlated with price. I wonder which variable is more important to price, cut or clarity, but I'm not sure yet how to answer this question.

# Communication
<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

In this next stage, you will render your data exploration, push it to GitHub to share with others, and link your observations within our [Data Science Wiki](https://olin-data-science.fandom.com/wiki/Olin_Data_Science_Wiki).

__q3__ *Knit* your document in order to create a report.

You can do this by clicking the "Knit" button at the top of your document in RStudio.

![Terminal](./images/c00-knit.png)

This will create a local `.md` file, and RStudio will automatically open a preview window so you can view your knitted document.

__q4__ *Push* your knitted document to GitHub.

![Terminal](./images/c00-unstaged.png)

You will need to stage both the `.md` file, as well as the `_files` folder. Note that the `_files` folder, when staged, will expand to include all the files under that directory.

![Terminal](./images/c00-staged.png)

__q5__ *Document* your findings in our [Wiki](https://olin-data-science.fandom.com/wiki/Olin_Data_Science_Wiki). Work with your learning team to come to consensus on your findings.

The [Datasets](https://olin-data-science.fandom.com/wiki/Datasets) page contains lists all the datasets we've analyzed together.

__q6__ *Prepare* to present your team's findings!

__q7__ Add a link to your personal data-science repository on the [Repositories](https://olin-data-science.fandom.com/wiki/Repositories) page. Make sure to file it under your team name!
